What is the general relationship between voltage and RPMs in a DC motor?

More volage in a DC motor makes that motor spin more

Would you describe this relationship as linear? Explain.

Yes, it's a linear because the voltage and Rpm both increase at a continuous rate

What statement would you use to accurately describe the relationship between these two variables?

The voltage is independant and the rpm is dependant on the voltage.
